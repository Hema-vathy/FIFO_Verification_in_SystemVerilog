# FIFO_Verification_in_SystemVerilog
This project verifies a FIFO design using SystemVerilog through various tests including basic write-read, overflow, underflow, simultaneous write-read, and read-write operations. An error counting task detects mismatches between expected and actual data, ensuring accurate functional verification and reliable FIFO performance.
